# Bookland-Backend

![Bookland Logo](https://github.com/ascendantaditya/Bookland-Backend/blob/main/Image/ok.jpg)

This is the backend for **Bookland**, a bookstore management system. The backend is built using **Go** with the **Gorm** ORM for database handling and **Gorilla Mux** for routing.

The **Bookland-Backend** uses a RESTful API structure, connecting a MySQL database with the frontend via the following components:
- **Go** for API logic.
- **Gorilla Mux** for routing.
- **Gorm** for managing database interactions.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

1. Install Gorm (Go ORM library):
   ```bash
   go get "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
   ```

2. Install the MySQL dialect for Gorm:
   ```bash
   go get "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/mysql"
   ```

3. Install Gorilla Mux for routing:
   ```bash
   go get "github.com/gorilla/mux"
   ```
